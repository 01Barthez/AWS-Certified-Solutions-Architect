# Concepts and Components:

1.   **AWS Global Infrastructure**:

    1. Regions: A place where AWS resources exists a geographical area, there are 15 regions (as of 2015).  
       Each region consists of multiple availability zones, currently 49 in total(as of 2017).  
       An Availability Zone(AZ) is simply a data center.

    2. Edge location: This is a CDN(Content-Delivery Network) endpoint. Edge locations are used by CloudFront   
       to cache files near the user where they access them.

    3. CDN: A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that deliver webpages,  
       and other web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user,  
       the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server.

     There are many more edge locations than there are regions. Currently 52 edge locations around the world

2.   **Networking**:

    1. Route 53: Amazon’s DNS service, basically allows you to host your domain name with Amazon.   
       53 is the DNS port. When you open up DNS world you do this on port 53

    2. Direct connect: Allows you to connect directly to where your Virtual Private Cloud(VPC) is located  
       using connection links to Amazon data center into your VPC, and you don't need internet to access it

    3. Virtual Private Cloud: A virtual data center as a collection of AWS resources, such as EC2 instances,   
       EBS instances, and Load Balancers

    4. CloudFront: Part of the CDN, consisting of edge locations to cache your assets, like videos, large media  
       files etc.

3.   **Compute Elements**:

    1. EC2: Known as Elastic Cloud Compute, allowing one to provision instances inside your VPC, these are  
       just virtual machines in the cloud that run on AWS

    2. EC2 Container Service: highly scalable, high performance container management service, supporting Docker  
       containers, allowing you to run applications on a managed cluster of EC2 instances, eliminating the need  
       to install, operate and scale your own cluster management infrastructure

    3. Elastic Beanstalk: An easy to use service for developing and scaling web apps developed in   
       Java, Dot Net etc., we can simply upload the code and EB will automatically handle the deployment from   
       capacity provisioning, load balancing, autoscaling, app health and monitoring.

    4. Lambda: Is Serverless. Upload your code to respond to events.

    5. Lightsail: A completely brand new service introduced in 2016. Allows anyone who does not understand AWS   
       to deploy a site in a few seconds

4.   **Storage**:
    1. S3(Simple Storage Service): S3 is a file-based storage or object based storage.  
       Allows us to store files in the cloud of sizes ranging from 1 byte to 5 terabytes

    2. Glacier: Is an archiving service. Allows us to archive all our data in the Amazon cloud,  
       not immediately accessible but take 3-5 hours to restore a file from Glacier,hence used for long-term storage

    3. EFS(Elastic File service): File based storage and you can share it, you can install databases, applications.

    4. Storage gateway: A service that connects on-premise software appliance with cloud based storage   
       to provide seamless and secure integration between organizations on premise IT equipment and AWS storage infrastructure.

5.   **Databases**:

    1. RDS(Relational Database Services): Consists of elements such as SQLServer by MS, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL,   
       and Amazon’s own database engine known as Aurora completely MySQL compatible db but designed to run specifically   
       on the AWS platform.

    2. DynamoDB: For NoSQL

    3. RedShift: A fast, fully-managed petabyte scaled datawarehousing solution,  
       that makes it simple and cost-effective to efficiently analyze your data using your existing BI tools.   
       It is designed from the infrastructure layer upwards to maximize performance and minimize cost.

    4. Elastic Cache: Allows/offers an in-memory caching service for the AWS platform.

6.   **Migration**
1. Snowball: This is a data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data,  
   into and out of AWS. It addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers such as high network costs,   
   long transfer times, and security concerns.

       2. DMS(Database Migration services): This allows migration of on-premise databases to AWS cloud  
         
       3. SMS(Server Migration Service): does same work as the DMS but targets virtual machines,  
           to replicate vms to aws cloud  

7.  **Analytics**:

          website clickstreams, social media, location tracking event.
        - With Kinesis client library ACL, we can build Amazon Kinesis apps,  
          and use streaming data to power real time dashboards, generate alerts, implement dynamic pricing and  
          advertising or more
        - We can emit data from Kinesis to other AWS services such as S3, redShift, Elastic MapReduce, and lambda

    3. ElasticMapReduce(EMR):
        - A web service that makes it easy to quickly and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data.
        - Uses Hadoop, an open source framework to distribute your data and process across a resizeable cluster of   
          Amazon EC2 instances.
        - It can also run other distributed framework such as Spark and Presto.
        - EMR is used in a variety of applications including log analysis, web-indexing, data warehousing,   
          machine learning, financial analysis, scientific simulation, and Bioinformatics,   
          customers launch millions of Amazon’s EMR clusters each year
        - Allows you root access(i.e. login via SSH)
